# StarWars Reversi

## Overview

> This was a project I did with a team of three developers during a two day hackathon. The objective was to make a web 
application for the classic Othello game and give it a theme. We chose StarWars. My part of the project was to 
code the logic for the game and the way it interacts with the visual components. Since we had extra time near the end, 
I managed to add in a computer controlled opponent. It was a great experience and I enjoyed working with my team.


#Future

> If I was to come back to this and work on it again, there are several changes I would make. 
- Make the AI significantly smarter and add in different difficulty levels
- Add an option for two human players to play
